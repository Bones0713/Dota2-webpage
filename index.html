        The International is fast approaching! After months of competition,
        <br />
        twelve teams have secured their invites to TI, with eight more set to
        <br />
        join them after the upcoming regional qualifiers.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <center>
      <p style="color: goldenrod">
        The International is watched by millions, from casual players to <br />
        seasoned veterans and retired pros. Every year we look for new <br />
        opportunities to make The International even more exciting, entertaining
        <br />
        and accessible than ever before. This year, we've focused on improving
        <br />
        the viewing experience for a broader range of fans. While no format can
        <br />
        be perfect, we're always trying to strike a balance between things that
        <br />
        have worked in the past and things that could work even better in the
        <br />
        future.

        So with TI 2023 on the horizon, we wanted to walk you through every
        <br />
        detail of the format changes we&apos;re trying out this year, and our
        <br />
        thought process behind them.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <center>
      <p style="color: goldenrod">
        One obvious difference this year is the event schedule. A live <br />
        competition is always more exciting when people can watch it as <br />
        it&apos;s actually happening, not hours or days later, and we wanted to
        <br />
        make it easier for more people to do that.
      </p>
    </center>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <center>
      <p style="color: goldenrod">
        To that end, we're scheduling nearly every game over a <br />
        Friday-through-Sunday weekend break. It'll take three weekends to fit in
        <br />
        all the games for a twenty-team tournament — a weekend for <br />
        <strong>Group Stage</strong>Group Stage (October 12-15), a weekend for
        <br />
        <strong>Playoffs</strong> (October 20-22), and a weekend for
        <strong>The Finals</strong> (October 27-29).

    </center>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <center>
      <p style="color: goldenrod">
        As a landmark esports event, The International attracts viewers who have
        <br />
        never played Dota, or even watched a live gaming event. We hear a <br />
        consistent message from first-time watchers: that TI is exciting, but
        <br />
        can sometimes feel overwhelming. There are so many matches happening,
        <br />
        new viewers can find it difficult to understand which to focus on.
        <br />
      </p>
    </center>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <center>
      <p style="color: goldenrod">
        So, this year we've split "The International" into two distinct phases,
        <br />
        with two distinct names: <strong>The Road To The International</strong>,
        <br />
        which includes Group Stage and Playoffs and captures all of the drama of
        <br />
        pitting the best 20 Dota teams against each other until only eight
        <br />
        remain; and <strong>The International itself</strong>, where those final
        <br />
        eight teams battle to claim the Aegis of Champions. <br />
      </p>
    </center>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <center>
      <p style="color: goldenrod">
        So if you're already invested in Dota (and if you've read this far,
        <br />
        that&apos;s probably a yes), and want to watch every step of every
        <br />
        journey, you'll still start it with The Road to The International — you
        <br />
        can watch the Group Stage as you usually would, and the Playoffs will
        <br />
        still be played live in front of an audience. And if you're new to Dota
        <br />
        or The International, and just want to experience the biggest moments of
        <br />
        the event, we&apos;ve made it clearer what they are and when you can see
        <br />
        them.
      </p>
    </center>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <center><h2 style="color: lightgoldenrodyellow">Group Stage</h2></center>

    <center>
      <p style="color: goldenrod">
        In the old Group Stage format, two groups of ten teams would play Roundv
        <br />
        Robin over the course of four frantic days, usually five games at a
        <br />
        time. This meant that each team was playing so many matches that early
        <br />
        games just didn't feel meaningful. It also meant that a lot of matches
        <br />
        in the final days of Group Stage were literally meaningless, because
        <br />
        they wouldn&apos;t actually affect the final standings. The challenge,
        <br />
        then, was to come up with a Group Stage format that heightened the
        <br />
        stakes of each and every game.
      </p>
    </center>
    <center><img src="images/groupstage.png" alt="groupstage photo" /></center>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <center>
      <p style="color: goldenrod">
        In the new Group Stage format, instead of two groups of ten teams <br />
        playing for four days, four groups of five will now play for two, with
        <br />
        the bottom team in each group getting eliminated. This means that every
        <br />
        team will now only play four games instead of the previous nine, making
        <br />
        every game impactful to a team’s final standings in the group.
      </p>
    </center>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <center>
      <p style="color: goldenrod">
        Additionally, the second half of Group Stage is now composed of <br />
        head-to-head matches between the remaining 16 teams, which will decide
        <br />
        which teams enter the Playoffs in the Upper Bracket.
      </p>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <center><h2 style="color: lightgoldenrodyellow">Playoffs</h2></center>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <center>
      <p style="color: goldenrod">
        Playoffs kick off on Friday, October 20th at the Seattle Convention
        <br />
        Center&apos;s Summit, featuring the top eight teams fighting for the
        <br />
        four Upper Bracket slots of The International. Saturday and Sunday will
        <br />
        consist of a series of elimination matches, with the four survivors
        <br />
        making it into TI&apos;s Lower Bracket. Unlike previous years, all
        <br />
        matches will be played in a best-of-three format.

        which team is the best in the world. Friday and Saturday will feature

        four best-of-three matches each day, and Sunday will feature a battle
